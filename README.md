# Calculator Python Project

Python program that allows users to input two numbers, choose a mathematical operator, and return the results of the calculation. 

Create a basic calculator in Python and submit this as a *.py file:
Create an addition user-defined function that accepts two numbers
Create a subtraction user-defined function that accepts two numbers
Create a multiplication user-defined function that accepts two numbers
Create a division user-defined function that accepts two numbers
Output instructions to the user (well-formatted with good use of white space for easy reading)
Ask the user what type of calculation they want to run
Ask the user for two numbers
Perform the appropriate calculation and return the results
Continue performing mathematical operations unless the user chooses to exit
