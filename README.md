# Calculator-Python-Project

Task:  To complete this assignment, you should write a Python program that allows users to input two numbers, choose a mathematical operator, and return the results of the calculation. 

Note: There are a many online tutorials teaching you how to create a Python calculator. Don't cheat yourself and simply copy example code and submit it as your own; you won't learn what you need to if you do and you won't be prepared for the next assignments. 

Create a written explanation of your code in a separate text document. Utilize the idea of a recipe (as noted in the readings) to describe the data and the routines required for this application's completion. Submit this as a Word document in addition to your *.py code.

Create a basic calculator in Python and submit this as a *.py file:
Create an addition user-defined function that accepts two numbers
Create a subtraction user-defined function that accepts two numbers
Create a multiplication user-defined function that accepts two numbers
Create a division user-defined function that accepts two numbers
Output instructions to the user (well-formatted with good use of white space for easy reading)
Ask the user what type of calculation they want to run
Ask the user for two numbers
Perform the appropriate calculation and return the results
Continue performing mathematical operations unless the user chooses to exit
